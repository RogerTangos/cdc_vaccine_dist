cdc_vaccine_dist
================

A class project to design a high-leve java-based l vaccine tracking system for the CDC.

-A helpful app_overview presentation is also provided in _app_overview_.pdf.
-You can run the app without compiling by opening dist/Final_2011-12-14--001.jar.jar
-Documentation is available at dist/javadoc/index.html

This was the first piece of software I wrote. The code is neat, but often quite naive.
